Music Keeper is an iOS application developed with Swift, which provides tools to help Spotify users organise their playlists, analyse and gain insights into their Spotify playlists and music tastes, and discover new songs that match their unique tastes.
Spotify API was extensively utilised to fetch music metadata, user library data and playlist information, enabling a range of functionalities.
Algorithms were implemented to analyse user playlists with the data fetched, providing insights into their music preferences based on factors such as tempo, energy, and genres.
